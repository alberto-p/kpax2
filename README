K-Pax2 - Bayesian Cluster Analysis of Categorical Data
======================================================

About
-----

K-Pax2 is a R package, written with the purpose of clustering (big) datasets
of categorical statistical variables. Main application of K-Pax2 is with
genetic datasets, such as dna/protein multiple sequence alignments. Being a
general method, it can be easily applied to any kind of categorical dataset.
K-Pax2 output consists of a classification of both the rows (statistical units)
and columns (statistical variables) of the provided data matrix.

Downloading
-----------

You can find the latest version of K-Pax2 at:
http://www.helsinki.fi/bsg/software/kpax2/

Installation
------------

Download kpax2_x.x.x.zip file and extract its content into a folder of your
choice.

a) Preferred (easy) approach
Run R and type the following command:

install.packages("path_to_package_file.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")

where "path_to_package_file.tar.gz" is the complete path to the package file,
contained in the folder you have chosen earlier.

If R is run with administrative privileges, the previous command will install
the library to the default system library, making it available to every other
user on the same machine.

You can now load the package from within R by issuing the command:

library(kpax2)

Windows users: within R, file paths should be written using the slash '/'
               character instead of the usual backslash '\' character. If
               you want to use the backslash, then you have to escape it
               first (i.e. use '\\'). Examples of valid file paths:

               "C:/Users/Current_User/Downloads/kpax2/kpax2_x.x.x.tar.gz"
               "C:\\Users\\Current_User\\Downloads\\kpax2\\kpax2_x.x.x.tar.gz"

b) Advanced approach
If you want to make K-Pax2 available to everybody, then you will need to
install it to the system R library folder. Its path depend on the system we are
running R on, so please check where it is. It is actually possible to install
the package wherever you want. From now on, we will refer to its path as LIB.

From the command line, run (you will probably need root privileges):

R CMD INSTALL --library=LIB path_to_package_file.tar.gz

where path_to_package_file.tar.gz is the complete path to the package file,
contained in the folder you have chosen earlier.

If it fails to find command R, then it means that it is not in the system path.
In this case, you will need to cd to its directory first:

cd path_to_R_binary_folder
R CMD INSTALL --library=LIB path_to_package_file.tar.gz

On Windows, it would look something like this (note in this case the use of the
backslash character):

cd "C:\Program Files\R\R-x.x.x\bin"
R CMD INSTALL --library="C:\Program Files\R\R-x.x.x\library" "C:\Users\Current_User\Downloads\kpax2\kpax2_x.x.x.tar.gz"

You can now load the package from within R by issuing the command:

library(kpax2)

If you installed the package into a non-standard folder, use:

library(kpax2, lib.loc=LIB)
